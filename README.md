# React Native with Expo, React Navigation, and TypeScript with a clean architecture

This is a starter project for building React Native apps with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using a clean architecture.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Roble project ID

   ```
   ROBLE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Dependencies
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) - A framework and platform for universal React applications.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation for your React Native
- [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/) - An asynchronous, unencrypted, persistent, key-value storage system for React Native.

## Functions

- Product management (create, update, delete) with Roble
